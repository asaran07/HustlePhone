# HustlePhone
HustlePhone is a narrative-driven game where you experience its story through branching dialogues and paths while navigating through different character storylines and making choices that significantly impact the game's outcome. It is developed using Java, FXML, and JSON.

## Current Development Status
My current focus is on a stable release that includes the core functionality, and my goal is to design the game in a way that makes it easy to add more mechanics, such as animations, music, mini-games, quests, new characters, and storylines.
